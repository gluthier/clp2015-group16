We wrote a complete compiler. It starts by reading the code and decoding it as \lstinline$Tokens$. With the \lstinline$Tokens$, it parse them by following the grammar imposed by the \lstinline$Tool$ language. Then it analyze it and attribute each \lstinline$Identifier$ a symbol in order to know which variable it is using. At the end, it checks the types of all \lstinline$Identifier$ and generate the associated code.
